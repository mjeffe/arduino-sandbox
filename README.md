# arduino-sandbox
Playground with a few sketches I used when learning arduino

I wouldn't recommend using any of this code. I was learning and using other
peoples code. In fact (it's been a while, so I don't remember), but I think
some of these sketches are the examples that came with the arduino IDE at the
time.
